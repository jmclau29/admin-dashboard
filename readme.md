This project is an admin dashboard for The Odin Project. I used CSS Grid to make an admin dashboard.

I spent five months on and off working on this project (mostly spent procrastinating, to my deep regret). 
I tried to make a page close in appearance to the layout example provided. 
I used CSS grid as much as possible to make the layout of the page. I also attempted to make the grid for the center project cards responsive to a certain degree, though I'm not sure how well I might have done.

I feel that the CSS stylesheet is messier than it could be, and could use some work being cleaned up and made easier to read. If I were to continue, a streamlining of the stylesheet would be my next goal.
